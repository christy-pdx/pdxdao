          PDX DAO functions as a permissionless coalition of DAOs.
          Anyone can create a DAO in the PDX DAO ecosystem and any DAO can join the ecosystem.
        
          
          Membership eligibility is a social
          construct emergent from the relationships of participating orgs. As we grow as a
          coalition, we will be building out a decentralized governance model with an eye
          toward an on-chain democratic confederation.

            A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, describes a new way
            for humans to work together toward a shared vision without the need
            for centralized power. A DAO is typically defined by its smart
            contract‚Äîthe blockchain-based protocol in place for shared
            management of the community treasury‚Äîand by the purpose, governance
            structure, and vibe of the community.
