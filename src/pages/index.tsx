        What&apos;s a DAO?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, describes a new way for
        humans to work together toward a shared vision without the need for
        centralized power. A DAO is typically defined by its smart contractâ€”the
        blockchain-based protocol in place for shared management of the
        community treasuryâ€”and by the purpose, governance structure, and vibe of
        the community.
