This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo and install dependencies

git clone https://github.com/christy-pdx/pdxdao.git
cd pdxdao

Then, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit pages by modifying files within the `/src/pages` folder, and components within the `/src/components` folder. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
