			<h3><b>PDX DAO</b> is an IRL DAO based in Portland, OR, whose members share an interest in the implementation and application of Ethereum and web3 technologies, tools and decentralized systems, as a means to promote the Ethereum ecosystem while benefiting our local communities.</h3>
			<p>PDX DAO plays a working role in supporting <b>EthPDX</b>â€”Portland's Ethereum community, organized via <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ethpdx/" target="_blank">Meetup.com â†—</a>. The purpose of EthPDX is to support community networking, learning, and building. Anyone can attend an EthPDX event, you donâ€™t need to be a member of the DAO. <b>The best way to learn more is to attend EthPDX meetups and events.</b> There, youâ€™ll be able to ask questions and get a sense of the vibe of our community.

            <p><b>What does PDX DAO do?</b> We organize to support community-level thrivingâ€”manifested in a growing variety of ways, including organizing meetup and educational events, and offering web3-related opportunities for local creators.

            <p><b>Whatâ€™s a DAO?</b> A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, describes a new way for humans to work together toward a shared vision without the need for centralized power. A DAO is typically defined by its smart contractâ€”the protocol in place for shared management of the community treasuryâ€”and by the purpose and vibe of the community.
