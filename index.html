			<h3><b>PDX DAO</b> is a local community DAO based in Portland, OR, whose members share an interest in the implementation and application of Ethereum and web3 technologies, tools and decentralized systems, as a means to promote the Ethereum ecosystem while benefiting our local communities.</h3>
			<p>PDX DAO plays a working role in supporting <b>EthPDX</b>â€”Portland's Ethereum community, organized via <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ethpdx/" target="_blank">Meetup.com â†—</a>. The purpose of EthPDX is to support community networking, learning, and building. Anyone can attend an EthPDX event, you donâ€™t need to be a member of the DAO. The best way to learn more is to attend EthPDX meetups and events. There, youâ€™ll be able to ask questions and get a sense of the vibe of our community. Weâ€™d be happy to meet you!</p>
            <p><b>What does PDX DAO do?</b> We organize to support community-level thrivingâ€”manifested in a growing variety of ways, including organizing meetup and educational events, and offering web3-related opportunities for local creators. We work together collaboratively to produce projects that benefit the community. PDX DAO is currently comprised of the following working groups: Communication and Design, Community Engagement, Funding, and Tech and Education.</p>
            <p><b>Who joins PDX DAO?</b> Anyone who is interested in building in web3 on Ethereum, while actively contributing to our community. DAO members are comprised of folks from across the spectrums of background, experience, and level of technical proficiency. All DAO members are welcome to submit proposals to the group. Trusted DAO members gain proposal approval rights and scaled voting power. There are several existing paths to becoming a trusted member, and any individual is always welcome to forge their own path through active community involvement.</p>
            <p><b>Whatâ€™s a DAO?</b> A Distributed Autonomous Organization, or DAO, describes a new decentralized way for humans to work together in alignment with a shared purpose. A DAO is typically defined by its smart contractâ€”the protocol in place for shared management of the community treasuryâ€”and by the purpose and vibe of the community.
